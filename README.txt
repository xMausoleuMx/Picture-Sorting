A program meant to rank a directory of pictures based on how much the user likes them.
Useful if you need to trim a large collection of images or want to pick your favorites.

Ranks by showing two images and has the user pick which he likes more. The selected one will gain
a point and then the program will rerank if necesary. 

When ranking a large image collection it is almost impossible to get a completed selection (as n! comparions would be needed)
